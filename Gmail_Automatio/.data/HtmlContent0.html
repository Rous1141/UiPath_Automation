<P>Hello, Fenzf.<FONT color=#993300> This is Annie speaking</FONT>.</P>
<P>As you're informed, we are having a quite ruckus issue in<FONT color=#ff0000> Former Hell</FONT> regarding the contract with the construction of the greyser underground nuclear facility proposed by the<FONT color=#339966> Moriya God</FONT>. The mistress of the<FONT color=#ff99cc> Palace Of Spirit Earth</FONT>, owner of the Yatagaratsu's consumer "<FONT color=#800000>Okuu</FONT>", head lady<FONT color=#ff00ff> Komeiji Satori</FONT> is forbidden the use of her animal for any business relating with the surface dweller. This is a headache news. I am aware of your current busy lamend on other floors of <FONT color=#ff0000>Hell</FONT>, but I would like you to take a detour to the Palace&nbsp;and perhaps convince lady <FONT color=#ff00ff>Satori</FONT> to cooperate with the <FONT color=#339966>Moriya Godesses</FONT>. This deal is far more important to the populance of Hell then that selfish Komeiji ever realized.<BR><BR>Thank you for your hard work,</P>
